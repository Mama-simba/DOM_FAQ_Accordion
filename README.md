### What I learned

Thanks to this tutorial I have learnt and practised the following DOM manipulation concepts:
- getElementsByClassName()
- addEventListener()
- for loop
- classList.toggle()

Would you like to know what the DOM is and what other concepts exist to manipulate and make cool and fun interactions? I have created 2 tutorials to explain and put in practise all concepts. Check them out:

- [DOM manipulation II: How to create and remove elements & manipulate classes and attributes](https://www.cristina-padilla.com/dom2.html).
